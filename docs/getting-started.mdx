Kindred runs your agent in a safe sandbox and tells you if it passes or fails. You get a clear result plus the exact reason if something goes wrong.

**Use Kindred if your agent:** calls tools, changes state, or cannot afford silent failures.

**What you run:** Run test suites against your agent and get pass or fail plus a reason.

## Connect your agent

Implement a POST `/run_step` endpoint that receives observations and returns actions.

**Request example:**

```bash
POST /run_step
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "run_id": "...",
  "step_index": 1,
  "observation": { ... }
}
```

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "action": {
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "args": {}
  }
}
```

## First run

1. Register your agent and get a token
2. Point Kindred at your `/run_step` endpoint
3. Run a suite

Every run produces a trace showing exactly why it passed or failed.
