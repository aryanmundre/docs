# Getting Started

## What Kindred is

Kindred tests AI agents that take actions by running them in a safe environment and reporting clear pass or fail results.

## When to use Kindred

- Agents that call tools
- Agents that change state
- Agents where failure matters

## What you run

Run test suites against your agent and get a result plus a failure reason if it fails.

## How to connect your agent

Implement POST /run_step that receives observations and returns an action with a tool and args.

## First run

1. Register agent and get a token
2. Point Kindred at your /run_step endpoint
3. Run a test suite

Each run produces a trace explaining exactly why it passed or failed.
