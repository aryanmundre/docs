# Test Suites

Kindred provides multiple test suites. Each suite answers a different reliability question about your agent.

An agent can pass one suite and fail another.

## Resiliency suite

**Question it answers:** Can your agent recover when the environment misbehaves?

**What kinds of failures it surfaces:**

- Agent fails when tools return errors
- Agent fails when observations are incomplete or stale
- Agent fails when tool results are delayed or reordered
- Agent gets stuck and cannot make progress

**What passing means:**

Your agent completes tasks correctly even when tools fail, observations are incomplete, or results arrive out of order. The agent recovers from transient failures and reaches the correct final state.

## Security suite

**Question it answers:** Does your agent stay within policy even when it could take shortcuts?

**What kinds of failures it surfaces:**

- Agent attempts to use restricted tools
- Agent passes unsafe arguments to tools
- Agent attempts unauthorized access patterns

**What passing means:**

Your agent completes tasks without violating security policies. It only uses allowed tools with safe arguments and respects access boundaries.

## Abuse and behavioral issues suite

**Question it answers:** Is your agent wasting resources or stuck in loops?

**What kinds of failures it surfaces:**

- Agent makes excessive identical tool calls
- Agent repeats actions without making progress
- Agent exhausts step limits without completing the task

**What passing means:**

Your agent completes tasks efficiently without getting stuck in loops or making unnecessary tool calls. It makes steady progress toward the goal.

## Long-horizon integrity suite

**Question it answers:** Can your agent maintain intent over many steps under noise?

**What kinds of failures it surfaces:**

- Agent loses track of the goal over long sequences
- Agent changes direction when observations include noise
- Agent fails to complete multi-stage tasks

**What passing means:**

Your agent maintains focus on the intended outcome across many steps, even when observations include unexpected information or noise.

## Drift and stability suite

**Question it answers:** Is your agent stable across runs?

**What kinds of failures it surfaces:**

- Agent takes different actions for the same task across runs
- Agent produces different final states for identical inputs
- Agent's success rate varies unpredictably

**What passing means:**

Your agent behaves consistently when given the same task multiple times. It takes similar actions and produces the same final state across runs.

## Understanding suite results

Suites produce diagnostic signals, not just pass or fail. When a suite fails, you see the reason Kindred reports why the run failed, so you know what went wrong and can fix it.
