# Reading a Run

## What a run shows

- What the agent saw
- What the agent did
- What happened as a result
- Final result and failure reason

## How to debug a failure

1. Find the step where the run failed
2. Read the reported failure reason
3. Inspect the agent action at that step
4. Check whether the environment behaved unexpectedly

## Failure types

Some failures mean the agent produced the wrong outcome.

Some failures mean the agent got stuck or behaved inefficiently over time.
