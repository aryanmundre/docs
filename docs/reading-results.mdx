# Reading Results

Each run produces a full step-by-step trace that shows exactly what happened during execution.

## Run timeline

The timeline shows each step in sequence.

**For each step, the trace shows:**

- The observation sent to the agent
- The agent's raw action (before validation)
- The agent's validated action (after schema and policy checks)
- Any faults applied to the observation, action, or tool result
- The tool result returned to the agent
- Invariant evaluation results

Steps are numbered sequentially. The timeline ends when the run terminates.

## Interpreting failures

Failures occur at a specific step in the timeline.

**To identify the failure:**

1. Find the step where the failureMode was set
2. Check whether an invariant failed or an analyzer triggered
3. Examine the action or state that caused the failure
4. Review any faults that were injected at that step

Look for the first step where failureMode becomes non-NONE.

## Invariant failures versus analyzer failures

**Invariant failures:**

- Occur when semantic correctness is violated
- Happen at the step where the invariant is evaluated
- Show which invariant failed and why
- Indicate incorrect final state or forbidden action

**Analyzer failures:**

- Occur when behavioral pathology is detected
- May be detected after multiple steps show a pattern
- Show which analyzer triggered and what pattern was found
- Indicate inefficient or problematic behavior patterns

Both types of failures set a failureMode and cause the run to fail.

## Identifying root cause

From a single run, you can identify the root cause:

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1. Start at the failure step
2. Work backwards through the timeline
3. Identify the first action or state that led to the failure
4. Check if faults were injected that affected the outcome

**Key questions:**

- What action did the agent take that caused the failure?
- Was a fault injected that changed the expected behavior?
- Did the agent handle the fault correctly?
- Was the failure due to incorrect logic or unhandled edge case?

The trace provides all information needed to debug from a single run without re-running.
