# Reading Results

Every run produces a trace showing what the agent saw, what actions it chose, and what happened as a result.

## What you see in a run

**Steps in order:**

Each step shows one complete cycle of observation, action, and result.

**Observations sent to the agent:**

The world state the agent received at each step, including any data from previous tool calls.

**Actions the agent chose:**

The tool calls your agent requested, including the tool name and arguments.

**Tool results:**

What each tool call returned to the agent, including data, errors, or timeouts.

**Injected failures, if any:**

When Kindred simulated failures like tool errors or incomplete observations, these are marked in the trace.

**Final result:**

Whether the run passed or failed, and the reason Kindred reports when a run fails.

## How to debug a failure

1. Find the step where the run failed

Look for the step where the final result shows failure.

2. Read the failure reason Kindred reports

The failure reason explains what went wrong, such as incorrect final state, policy violation, or getting stuck in a loop.

3. Inspect what the agent did at that step

Check what action the agent chose and what tool result it received.

4. Check whether the environment behaved unexpectedly

Review whether any failures were injected that the agent should have handled, or if the agent made an incorrect decision.

## Types of failures

Some failures mean the agent produced the wrong outcome. The agent completed the task but the final state is incorrect, or the agent took a forbidden action.

Some failures mean the agent got stuck or behaved inefficiently. The agent repeated the same actions without making progress, made too many unnecessary tool calls, or exhausted step limits without completing the task.
